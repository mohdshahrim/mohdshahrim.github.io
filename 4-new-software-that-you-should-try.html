    <p>When was the last time you get frustrated at using conputer because the software you are using suck?</p>

    <p>For instance, I hate web browsers or text editor that start out as useful, only to evolve into 'monsters' that demand computing power in exchange for free AI-powered feature that I didn't ask for.</p>
    
    <p>Well, AI is unavoidable, but the software has changed so bad from the first day I install them.</p>

    <p>Luckily, alternatives exist! Some are brand new, while others are the evolution toward becoming better.</p>

    <p>Here are 4 <b>new</b> software that you should try:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Helium (web browser)</li>
        <li>Zed (code editor)</li>
        <li>Affinity Studio (creative suite)</li>
        <li>LibreOffice (office suite)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Helium</h3>

    <table class="table-detail">
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>web browser</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>website</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td><a href="https://helium.computer/">https://helium.computer</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <p>Chrome sucks, so I migrated to Brave. But Brave sucks too. Then I met Helium and left the bloated browsers forever.</p>

    <p>Helium is a trimmed-down Chromium and quite new. The first ever release for Windows-build was 15 August 2025.</p>

    <p>Others have <a href="https://dtptips.com/the-rise-of-the-helium-browser-a-deep-dive/">written</a> about Helium as well.</p>

    <h3>Zed</h3>

    <table class="table-detail">
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>code editor</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>website</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td><a href="https://zed.dev/">https://zed.dev</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <img src="13-2.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>Like most people, I use VSCode, and VSCode is a web browser <a href="https://mohdshahrim.github.io/invention-reinvention-repurpose.html">repurposed</a> into text editor.</p>

    <p>But ever since Rust programming language grew in popularity and adoption, more and more new, competitive, and performant software emerge in the software market - from Linux drivers, game engines, network tools, and now to text editor.</p>

    <p>Zed is a code editor written in Rust, with comparable feature vis-à-vis to VSCode. Initially there were only Mac and Linux version and I've only been able to try it after they release the Windows build last October.</p>

    <h3>Affinity Studio</h3>

    <table class="table-detail">
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>creative suite/desktop publishing (raster, vector)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>website</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td><a href="https://www.affinity.studio/">https://www.affinity.studio</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <img src="13-3.png" width="100%"/>

    <p>If you're familiar with Photoshop, this is another new but actually not so new desktop publishing software.</p>
    
    <p>Affinity has been around for years, competing with Adobe for market share. But with recent Canva acquisition of Serif (in 2024), Affinity is repacked into single freemium creative application.</p>

    <p>I may still fond of CS5 era of Photoshop, but after giving Affinity Studio a shot, I must say, this is actually a great alternative.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>LibreOffice</h3>

    <table class="table-detail">
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td>office suite</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>website</td>
            <td>:</td>
            <td><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">https://www.libreoffice.org/</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <br>

    <p><b>Germany</b>'s state Schleswig-Holstein, <b>Denmark</b>'s Ministry of Digitalization, and even <b>Austria</b>'s millitary ditched Microsoft Office (or Office 365) for LibreOffice. These are no small attempts at achieving digital sovereignty.</p>

    <p>LibreOffice is a free and open source office suite software that can compete head on with Microsoft Office 365.</p>

    <p>It sucked during its early years - I've tried it, but with the release of version 25, LibreOffice is changing the game and catching up.</p>

    <p>Oh by the way, as an IT guy, my advice, <b>please do not use WPS</b>.</p>
