    <p><i>Bersejarah, di kenali ramai, Sekolah Abang Ali...</i></p>
    <p><i>Mencipta nama di semua arena, mengharum nama diri...</i></p>

    <br>

    <p>Oh excuse me. I was singing a school anthem.</p>

    <p>It has been 24 years but I still remember it.</p>

    <p>Proudly, such is a proof that I had been to that great school. Of course, anyone can refute the claim by saying I copied the lyric somewhere and paste it here. If you did, thank you for being critical.</p>

    <p>As signalled by the lyric's first word: <b>"Bersejarah"</b>, feast your eyes on these historical documents to show that I am indeed was a student of SK Abang Ali Sibu, along with 2 other memorabilia.</p>

    <h3>My first school, SK Abang Ali, Sibu</h3>

    <h3>Madrasatul Islamiah Sibu</h3>

    <p>My parents also sent me to Islamic tuition in the afternoon. I was introduced to the learning of Arabic language.</p>

    <p>This school is owned and managed by LAKIS, which stands for Lembaga Amanah Kebajikan Islam Sarawak.</p>

        <figcaption>The thick lamination used on this card made it sturdy and bendable, preserving much of the paper from water vapor and mold.</figcaption>

    <h3>SMC Public Library, Sibu</h3>

    <p>I am also a member of local library. Am still now.</p>

    <h3>Knowing history is half of wisdom. The other half is knowing what to do with it</h3>

    <p>These historical documents are the source of history.</p>

    <p>"Sources are our way of peering into the past" - Emma Groeneveld, <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1048/sources-of-history/">World History Encyclopedia</a></p>

    <p>As for me, the truly important message of this snippet from the past means my parent did a lot in their capacity to expose me to the seeking of knowledge. I may not turn up to become a successful person, but I did develop a mind and habit to love knowledge and the search for it.</p>

    <p>In the next part, I will find some more historical documents and together we pry open what the past can teach us.</p>
