    <h1>I thought Cybertrooper isn't real</h1>

    <p class="subhead">and I didn't know it was exclusively a Malaysian thing</p>

    <br>

    <p>10 Jan 2026</p>

    <br>

    <br>

    <p>I'm sure you noticed this too.</p>

    <p>One day you browse Facebook. Your feeds are saturated with memes and AI slops. Meanwhile MIM, PHM and "Madani" thing pops up at a usual amount. You occassionally laugh at Padapoik or MGAG, or got lost in Reels infinitely.</p>

    <p>It's a normal day in Facebook if that's the case. Until you stumble upon and look closer at one or two random posts about Malaysian Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim (or PMX for short).</p>

    <p>You can't just read titles. You have to check the sources and facts. Sometimes, you have to enter the comments section.</p>

    <p>You will find a phenomena not found elsewhere on the globe. The cybertroopers and their comments.</p>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-0.jpg" height="250px" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Malaysia and Turkiye, Sejarah and Diplomasi</h3>

    <p>PMX visited Turkiye (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1KLsgcu7P4/">link to the FB post</a>). It was a proud moment for us Malaysians to have a healthy diplomatic relationships with foreign nations. I personally respect PMX for his charm and professionalism.</p>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-1.jpg" height="250px" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <p>But when I look at comments section on some of the said posts, I found a "suspiciously numerous" of comments praising PMX. It's not just the quantity that pique my interest, but more especially the "unusually similar" from comments to comments.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Below is taken from TVS Facebook post (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/17w6oW6AkP/">link</a>)</p>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-2.jpg" height="250px" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <p>At the time of screenshot, it has around 460 reactions, 251 comments and 6 shares.</p>

    <br>

    <p>It's common to see people expressing support or reject toward PMX (or to any politicians or figures in general). Like this comment below:</p>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-3.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>As we scroll further, we can't help but to notice that there are so much comments like these:</p>

    <br>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-4.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <br>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-5.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>This is anomaly. The occurence of word "sejarah" in random sample is higher than normal.

    <p>I'm not the only one. This person noticed the same thing.</p>

    <br>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-6.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>So inorganic you can almost predict them</h3>

    <p>Take a look at the post below (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/16jK1qsRYr/">link</a>).</p>

    <p>Pay attention at these two keywords found in the image:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Kepercayaan</li>
        <li>Kerjasama</li>
    </ol>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-7.jpg" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>Tell me. What can you find in these four comments below?</p>

    <br>

    <div>
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/15-8.png" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>So inorganic and forced.</p>

    <p>At this point, at least we know the people who orchestrated this 'operation' may want to flood and dominate the digital platforms with the impression that PMX is very much supported by the mass. Don't get me wrong, he (PMX) does have a substantial support and admiration. But to stage an impression of it imply that the support he has is "bought" and "bogus".</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>A bit of plot twist (probably)</h3>

    <p>It's easy to discredit PMX by assuming he paid people to worship him online.</p>

    <p>I do feel disgusted at these cybertroopers and as a result, I feel disgusted at PMX as well.</p>

    <p>Did you get my logic?</p>

    <p>A person may hate PMX and his camp because of what these cybertroopers did. Utterly annoying and invasive. You don't need to be super smart to spot how artificial and pathetic the cybertroopers are. Are they even trying? or trying too hard. Either way, the <i>task failed successfully</i>.</p>

    <p>So the irony here is, people will actually hate PMX even more.</p>

    <p>Who knows. Maybe the political opponets set this cybertroopers up.</p>

    <p>Since we don't have proofs, let's just move on.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Did you know, the "cybertrooper" or "cytro" is exclusively a Malaysian term and nuance?</p>
