    <h1>List of people that I want to meet</h1>
    <p>22/3/2025</p>

    <br>

    <p>People avoid me for 1 reason - I'm socially awkward.</p>

    <p>But I avoid people for 2 reasons:</p>
    <p>1. They are not in the list of people that I want to meet</p>
    <p>2. They are Joykillers</p>

    <p>I can tolerate Lalangs and AttentionSeekers, but I don't tolerate Joykillers.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>If it's not too much to ask for, I want to meet these people:</p>

    <br>

    <h3>1. Tun Dr Mahathir</h3>

    <p>Do I have to explain? This man is 99 years old (as of writing), but his mind is still sharp.</p>
    <p>I have 2 of his books: Doctor in the House, and, The Malay Dilemma.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>2. Dr MAZA</h3>

    <p>Current Mufti of Perlis, a man with great intellect.</p>
    <p>He challenge the questionable norms of Islamic practices that has no origin in Quran and Sunnah. Paving way to fundamental Islamic tenets and critical thinking.</p>
    <p>He is also the only Mufti in Malaysia (that I ever known) to be well-versed in both Arabic and English.</p>


    <h3>3. Dr Omar Suleiman</h3>

    <p>American Palestinian, Islamic scholar, and activist.</p>
    <p>It is always captivating and enlightening to listen to his talk. If you want to increase in knowledge and become smarter, try to listen to smart people talking, everyday.</p>


    <h3>4. Senario</h3>

    <p>Who doesn't love Senario?</p>
    <p>Azlee, Wahid, Saipul Apek, Lan Pet Pet and Yasin. It's not because I adore them as actors on the screen. I adore them as they are: down-to-Earth humble, and lovable human beings.</p>
    <p>If you love "Lagi Lagi Senario", I will automatically love you.</p>


    <h3>5. M.Nasir</h3>

    <p>M. Nasir is the embodiment of music art itself, and a class of its own.</p>
    <p>Most artists chase fame because they are required to by the music industry. 5% singing, 95% cerita cerai.</p>
    <p>But M.Nasir just sit down, write music, sings, no time for BS (Busy Schedule).</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>This list is ongoing.</h3>
    <p>I shall update it from time to time. It takes a lot to be this creepy, writing down the peoples names, saying "I want to shake their hands..."</p>
