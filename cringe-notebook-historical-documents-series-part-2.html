    <h1>Cringe Notebook | Historical Documents Series (part 2)</h1>
    <p>22 Dec 2025</p>

    <br>

    <div class="bg-grey">
        <i>This is a dedicated series about historical sources. Focusing on old documents or memorable paraphernalia, mostly personal belongings.</i>
    </div>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>In <a href="/student-cards-historical-documents-series-part-1.html">Part 1</a>, I wrote about student cards. Those are memories during my school years.</p>
    
    <p>In this part, I'm going to take you to a time way recent than that, but not too recent of course, because otherwise it wouldn't be historically interesting.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>My cringeworthy notebook, circa 2012-2013</h3>

    <p>I used to have many notebooks. Only few survived.</p>
    
    <p>This notebook is the one I used to jot down class notes, exercises, random thoughts, and even certain secrets.</p>

    <p>It was salad.</p>

    <p>Some of the contents are about "C++", and this shall be the prominent topic of this post. I have something quite important to introspect.</p>

    <br>

    <div class="wk-div wk-div-75">
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/14-2.jpg" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
        <figcaption>The words and sentences arranged in varying indentations are called pseudocode. The diagram is called flowchart.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="wk-div wk-div-75">
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/14-3.jpg" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
        <figcaption>There's even math. This was probably MAT210 Discrete Mathematics.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="wk-div wk-div-75">
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/14-4.jpg" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
        <figcaption>At first glimpse, these looks boring. But look closely on the bottommost words: "refog kgb employee monitor". Google it.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <br>


    <h3>We were taught C++</h3>

    <p>C++, read as "C plus plus", is a computer programming language.</p>

    <p>We were introduced to C++ in Semester 1 course CSC128 (Fundamentals of Computer Problem Solving).</p>

    <p>The fact that C++ was chosen to be the introductory programming language to be taught to CS freshmen should tell you how important this language is. (there are thousands of programming languages in existence)</p>

    <br>

    <div class="wk-div wk-div-75">
        <img class="wk-img" src="img/14-5.jpg" width="100%" loading="lazy"/>
        <figcaption>C++ source code. I can't exactly remember what this program does.</figcaption>
    </div>

    <br>

    <p>Indeed. C++ is very important. At least for that time, it was among de-facto in software engineering industry.</p>

    <p>You may not appreciate it (some even hate it), but C++ is used for many many things:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>to create Windows and Microsoft Office,</li>
        <li>web browsers like Google Chrome,</li>
        <li>creative software like Adobe Photoshop</li>
        <li>video games,</li>
        <li>including and not limited to, medical technology, financial systems,</li>
        <li>and even military aircraft.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The list is endless.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>But we were not taught how to build software</h3>

    <p>We can't just create usable software from the knowledge of language syntax alone.</p>

    <p>C++ has its own "the professional way" of building software: the toolchain.</p>

    <p><b>Software toolchain</b> is a set of software development tools used to build and ship software.</p>

    <p>In other words, "software to create software". (I credit my cousin Arash for coining that expression)</p>

    <br>

    <p>Frankly, I don't know all of these. For instance, I may know Java but I don't know Maven or Gradle.</p>

    <p>It was only recently that I learn <a href="https://github.com/mohdshahrim/learn-tinyfiledialogs">how to include C third-party library</a> and perform the build process. That's my very first taste of toolchain.</p>

    <p>Toolchain is the bridge from mere "coding" to "runnable exe that the user mistakenly call as desktop shortcut".</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Computer science is not about computer</h3>

    <p>When you study computer science, you don't actually learn about the electronic computer itself. Instead, you are studying the theory of computation and problem solving. It is but a proud branch of mathematics.</p>

    <p>In a nutshell, software engineering is a separate discipline that actually design and build software/systems.</p>

    <p>You can use C++ to research what is the fastest way to sort data (computer science), or you can use C++ to create antivirus engine (software engineering).</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Over time, provided if we continuously learning and actively explore on our own, we could update our current understanding. (especially for university grad, don't expect University has taught you everything)</p>

    <p>What you learned and understood dearly years ago may be understood differently today. If not by you, it can be by other people.</p>

    <p>I'm not saying you were wrong. I'm saying you were relevant for a limited time.</p>

    <p>Other people may be wrong about how best to enjoy coffee. I was wrong about what Computer Science is for.</p>
