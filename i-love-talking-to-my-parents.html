    <h1>I love talking to my parents</h1>
    <p>15/5/2025</p>

    <br>

    <p>I'm rich.</p>

    <p>Not financially rich, but still rich.</p>

    <p><b>Because I still have my mum and dad.</b></p>

    <p>..and I love talking to them.</p>

    <p>I am now at the age where I appreciate my parents more than ever.</p>

    <p>I don't condemn anyone who doesn't like their parents. I understand that feelings. I've been there.</p>

    <p>My advice: respect your parents. No matter what.</p>

    <br>

    <p>I'm not the exemplary example there is, nor the wisest. I just stick to the basics:</p>

    <p>1. You won't be alive today if not because of your parents.</p>
    <p>2. Some people only realize the value of something after they lose it - don't be that people.</p>
    <p>3. Doing good to parents is an order from the God.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>I can't travel to the past, so I talk to my parents</h3>

    <p>Just so you know, I don't immediately picked up on the idea of enjoying conversation with my parents.</p>

    <p>I'm quite rebellious and authoritarian. More especially I have the role of the eldest male of the siblings.</p>

    <p>I went through and have seen more bitter episodes in my family than my siblings.</p>

    <p>You can guess how big is my ego given the circumstances.</p>

    <br>

    <pre style="text-align:center;">*     *     *</pre>

    <br>

    <p>It all started after I settled down.</p>

    <p>That's the time when men will face lots of new problems.</p>

    <p>And the best place to consult advices, is from older couples - my parents.</p>

    <p>When you get advices from old people, it comes with history anecdotes out of the box.</p>

    <p>Before I realize it, my parents walked me to the past, passing its door, all without moving an inch in the present body.</p>

    <p>A history enthusiasist myself, I enjoyed the 'trip'. I wished I had the chance to talk to my grandma again. She's even a bigger trove of history treasures and lessons.</p>

    <p>I may grow fond of hearing history tale, but I'm more relieved to have my problems heard. Sometimes my problems could be about work or anything, but I often get critical opinions or important retrospect in return.</p>

    <br>

    <h3>The time will come</h3>

    <p>The time will come when I can no longer meet my parents, let alone talking with them again.</p>

    <p>When that happens,... (I don't even know how to finish the very sentence)</p>

    <p>Regardless, I'm grateful. There are people out there who had it harder.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Be kind to your parents</h3>

    <p>Talk to them more. Show your utmost respect.</p>

    <p>Take heed from what God said in the Quran:</p>

    <blockquote>
        "And We have commanded people to ˹honour˺ their parents. Their mothers bore them through hardship upon hardship, and their weaning takes two years. So be grateful to Me and your parents. To Me is the final return."
    </blockquote>

        Al-Quran, Chapter Luqman, verse 14
