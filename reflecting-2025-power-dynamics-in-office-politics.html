    <h1>Reflecting 2025: Power Dynamics in Office Politics</h1>

    <p class="subhead">or how do you want to be remembered</p>

    <br>

    <p>25 Dec 2025</p>

    <br>

    <p>I remembered vividly. It was raining cats and dogs. Sibu town is drenched. Flood is imminent and already is in certain area. It could be worst, or unprecedented like Bintulu.</p>

    <p>It's only January-February and nature just said "hello" menacingly.</p>

    <p>That's power. The power of nature. Real and barely measurable.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>The power to dictate who gets what and how</h3>

    <p>There's another power to be reckoned with. Artificial, less frightening than flood, and requires a team of enablers to be realized.</p>

    <p>It's called politics.</p>

    <p>If done in workplace, it gets called "office politics".</p>

    <br>

    <p>Although it often goes hand in hand with formal authority, it's not necessarily bounded by it. I've seen a person with rank advantage but never exercise political influence at all.</p>

    <p>Funnily enough, there are those from the bottom of pyramid but with 'leader' complex, and they enjoy dominating the office. Watch out for the popular guy.</p>

    <p>Why populism? because unlike earthquake or flood, politicians need enablers to be and stay powerful.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>An Open Secret</h3>

    <p>We used to have a simpler political climate. Those at the top are politicians de jure. Their authority overshadowed their political motives. Whatever they do simply means whatever their designation are permitted to do.</p>

    <p>The math is basically like this: if you are a goodtalker, you are an asset, and because you are an asset, you get promotions. Thirty years ago, academic certs are the last thing they ask. If they ever ask.</p>

    <p>The ones left unpromoted at the lower rungs are usually those with lesser orator quality or troublemakers.</p>

    <br>

    <p>As time went on, new generations hop in. They don't just hop in to work here, they came with hope. Hoping to secure positions and career advancements.</p>

    <p>While many of them left after just barely warming the bench, those that stay finally learns an open secret.</p>

    <br>

    <p>The new generations are mostly university graduates or SPM holders at the very least. Their mere presence caused inflation on where we drew the line between junior executives and the low levels. These are common phenomena in many workplaces, where the new hires outrank the veterans.</p>

    <p>At this point, the landscape of office politics changed.</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Enablers, Assemble!</h3>

    <p>To rise and stay in power, you have to keep talking. Even in real politics, people don't appreciate YBs that work in silent.</p>

    <p>Now that the new gens happen to possess legitimate qualifications and demands, you have to play along with the policy you curated not too long ago. Something that says "if you have X, you can become Y".</p>
    
    <p>Promote their interest, or risk losing yours instead.</p>

    <p>Now is no longer about who is the goodtalker, because almost everyone in the room now is a goodtalker. If everyone is a goodtalker, who's gonna be the boss of who? If everyone is important, no one is.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Earlier this year we saw the last wave of promotions. Such a huge price to pay in order to maintain political supremacy because these are no ordinary arrangements. Following that is a new policy, that whoever is to be promoted next, must pass through a committee review.</p>

    <p>What this mean is promotions or succession are no longer policy. It is now a matter of political interest. They don't want competitors. Simple as that. This is not to imply the candidates aren't good.</p>

    <p>Did I ever mentioned that these promotions ████████████████?</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h3>Who are we working for exactly?</h3>

    <p>█████████████, but we do have a bit of changes across all departments (except mine). We are closing down our ███████ branch as well. ███████████████ █████████████ ███████.</p>

    <p>Despite all the commotion, the office politics here are still primitive yet dynamic. The element of goodtalking still sells like hotcakes.</p>

    <p>I'm not supposed to describe things in too detail. Maybe put it this way: the contenders seems to be unaware that they are in fact playing the politics and popularity contest that they despises so much in the first place. They won't admit they're doing it, but they go around paying lip service about what could be done for the betterment of all. That's what politicians do.</p>

    <p>In my perspective, these people steal the fun of working and socializing. I've had a hard time to carefully filter my words between 2 or 3 different enablers camps. Enablers are what I call those that lend support and encourage these contenders.</p>

    <p>What really annoys me is the fact that how detached they are, contenders and enablers, with reality. So what's you gonna do once you successfully form a coalition and lead?</p>
    
    <p>By logical sense, at the end of the day, real power comes from approval from authority. Having wielded the popularity mandate in the office doesn't mean anything unless you also wield authority at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>Only then you can dictate who gets what and how.</p>
